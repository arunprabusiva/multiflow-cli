## 🚀 Why MultiFlow?

**The Problem:** Modern applications span multiple repositories (frontend, backend, database, docs). Coordinating feature branches, commits, and PRs across repos is:
- ❌ Time-consuming and error-prone
- ❌ Leads to inconsistent branch states
- ❌ Makes code reviews complex
- ❌ Causes deployment headaches

**The Solution:** MultiFlow treats your multi-repo workspace as a single unit, enabling:
- ✅ **One command** to create feature branches everywhere
- ✅ **Synchronized commits** across all repositories
- ✅ **Profile-based workflows** - work on specific repo subsets
- ✅ **Smart Git operations** - pull, push, checkout across repos
- ✅ **Automated PR creation** with GitHub/GitLab URLs
- ✅ **Conflict detection** before merge attempts
- ✅ **Workspace health monitoring** and diagnostics
- ✅ **Visual status** of your entire feature workflow

## 📦 Installation

**Install from npm (recommended):**
```bash
npm install -g multiflow-cli
```

**Or clone and install locally:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/arunprabusiva/multiflow-cli.git
cd multiflow-cli
npm install
npm link
```

## 🎯 Quick Start

### 1. **Setup Your Workspace**
```bash
# Navigate to your multi-repo folder
cd /path/to/your/workspace
# Example structure:
# workspace/
# ├── frontend/     (React app)
# ├── backend/      (Node.js API) 
# ├── database/     (SQL migrations)
# └── docs/         (Documentation)

# Initialize MultiFlow
flow init
```

### 2. **Start a Feature**
```bash
# Creates feature/payment-system branch in ALL repos
flow feature create payment-system
```

### 3. **Make Your Changes**
```bash
# Edit files in any/all repositories
# frontend/src/PaymentForm.jsx
# backend/routes/payment.js  
# database/migrations/add_payments.sql
```

### 4. **Commit Across All Repos**
```bash
# Stages and commits changes in all repos with changes
flow feature commit payment-system -m "Add payment integration"
```

### 5. **Check Status**
```bash
flow status payment-system
```
**Output:**
```
payment-system
├─ frontend: feature/payment-system ✅ ready
├─ backend: feature/payment-system ✅ ready  
├─ database: feature/payment-system ⚪ untouched
└─ docs: feature/payment-system ✅ ready
```

### 6. **Publish & Merge**
```bash
# Push branches to remotes
flow feature publish payment-system

# Check for conflicts and prepare PRs
flow feature merge payment-system
```

### 7. **Cleanup When Done**
```bash
# Remove feature branches from all repos
flow feature cleanup payment-system
```

## 🧪 Live Test Example

Want to see MultiFlow in action? Here's a complete test you can run:

```bash
# 1. Create test workspace
mkdir multiflow-test && cd multiflow-test

# 2. Create mock repositories
mkdir frontend backend mobile
cd frontend && git init && echo "# Frontend" > README.md && git add . && git commit -m "Initial"
cd ../backend && git init && echo "# Backend" > README.md && git add . && git commit -m "Initial" 
cd ../mobile && git init && echo "# Mobile" > README.md && git add . && git commit -m "Initial"
cd ..

# 3. Initialize MultiFlow
flow init
# Output: Found 3 repositories ✅ Workspace initialized successfully

# 4. Create profiles for different workflows
flow profile create frontend-only --repos frontend
flow profile create fullstack --repos frontend backend mobile

# 5. Switch to frontend profile

## ⚙️ Configuration

MultiFlow creates a `.flow.yml` file in your workspace:

```yaml
repos:
  frontend:
    path: frontend
    hasRemote: true
    defaultBranch: main
  backend:
    path: backend  
    hasRemote: true
    defaultBranch: main
  mobile:
    path: mobile
    hasRemote: false
    defaultBranch: master
    
profiles:
  frontend-only:
    repos: [frontend]
    created: 2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z
  fullstack:
    repos: [frontend, backend, mobile]
    created: 2024-01-15T11:00:00.000Z
    
settings:
  activeProfile: fullstack
  
features:
  payment-system:
    branch: feature/payment-system
    repos: [frontend, backend, mobile]
    created: 2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z
```

## 🔧 Advanced Usage

### Working with Remotes
```bash
# MultiFlow automatically detects and works with:
# ✅ GitHub repositories
# ✅ GitLab repositories  
# ✅ Local-only repositories
# ✅ Mixed setups (some with remotes, some without)
```

### Multiple Features
```bash
# Work on multiple features simultaneously
flow feature create user-auth
flow feature create payment-system
flow feature create admin-panel

# Each feature is isolated per repository
flow status user-auth     # Shows user-auth branches
flow status payment-system # Shows payment-system branches
```

### Profile-Based Development
```bash
# Create profiles for different development workflows
flow profile create frontend-only --repos frontend shared-components
flow profile create backend-only --repos backend database
flow profile create fullstack --repos frontend backend mobile

# Switch between profiles
flow profile switch frontend-only
# Now all commands only affect: frontend, shared-components

flow feature create user-login
# Only creates branches in frontend & shared-components!

# List profiles with active indicator
flow profile list
# Output:
# ✅ frontend-only (2 repos) ← active
# ⚪ backend-only (2 repos)
# ⚪ fullstack (3 repos)
```

### Git Operations
```bash
# Pull/Push across all active repositories
flow pull    # Pull latest changes
flow push    # Push local changes

# Create pull requests with generated URLs
flow pr payment-system --title "Add Stripe integration"
# Output:
# 🔗 frontend: Create PR at: https://github.com/user/frontend/compare/main...feature/payment-system
# 🔗 backend: Create PR at: https://github.com/user/backend/compare/main...feature/payment-system
```

### Conflict Detection
```bash
# Before creating PRs, MultiFlow checks:
# ✅ Merge conflicts with main/master
# ✅ Files changed per repository
# ✅ Repositories with no changes

flow feature merge my-feature
# Output:
# ✅ frontend: Ready for PR (3 files changed)
# ⚠️  backend: Merge conflicts detected  
# ⚪ database: No changes to merge
```
