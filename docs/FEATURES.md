# üåä Multimflow Features Documentation

## üéØ Core Features

### 1. **Multi-Repository Management**
- **Auto-discovery**: Scans workspace for Git repositories
- **Unified operations**: Execute commands across all repositories simultaneously
- **Smart filtering**: Profile-based repository selection
- **Health monitoring**: Check workspace status and repository health

### 2. **Profile-Based Workflows**
```bash
# Create profiles for different development scenarios
mflow profile create frontend --repos frontend shared-components
mflow profile create backend --repos backend database api
mflow profile create fullstack --repos frontend backend mobile

# Switch between workflows
mflow profile switch frontend
# Now all operations only affect frontend repositories
```

**Use Cases:**
- **Frontend developers**: Work only on UI repositories
- **Backend developers**: Focus on API and database repositories  
- **Full-stack developers**: Coordinate across all repositories
- **Team leads**: Manage different project phases

### 3. **Feature Branch Management**
```bash
# Create feature branches across active repositories
mflow feature create user-authentication

# Commit changes across repositories with changes
mflow feature commit user-authentication -m "Add JWT authentication"

# Publish branches to remotes
mflow feature publish user-authentication

# Check merge readiness and conflicts
mflow feature merge user-authentication

# Clean up when done
mflow feature cleanup user-authentication
```

### 4. **Git Operations**
```bash
# Synchronize all repositories
mflow pull    # Pull latest changes from all remotes
mflow push    # Push local changes to all remotes

# Branch management
mflow checkout main              # Switch all repos to main branch
mflow checkout feature/new-ui    # Switch all repos to feature branch

# View changes
mflow diff payment-system        # Show cross-repository changes
mflow diff payment-system --summary  # Summary view only
```

### 5. **Pull Request Automation**
```bash
# Generate PR URLs for all repositories with changes
mflow pr payment-system --title "Add Stripe integration" --body "Implements payment processing"
```

**Output:**
```
üîó frontend: Create PR at: https://github.com/user/frontend/compare/main...feature/payment-system
üîó backend: Create PR at: https://github.com/user/backend/compare/main...feature/payment-system
üîó mobile: Create PR at: https://github.com/user/mobile/compare/main...feature/payment-system
```

### 6. **Workspace Diagnostics**
```bash
mflow doctor
```

**Checks:**
- Repository health and status
- Uncommitted changes
- Branch synchronization
- Remote connectivity
- Configuration validity

### 7. **Conflict Detection**
- **Pre-merge analysis**: Detect conflicts before attempting merges
- **Cross-repository impact**: Understand how changes affect multiple repos
- **File change tracking**: See exactly what files changed in each repository

## üîß Advanced Features

### Profile Management (CRUD)
```bash
# Create profiles
mflow profile create <name> --repos <repo1> <repo2>

# List all profiles with active indicator
mflow profile list

# Show detailed profile information
mflow profile show <name>

# Switch active profile
mflow profile switch <name>

# Delete profile (with confirmation)
mflow profile delete <name>
```

### Configuration Management
```bash
# Show current workspace configuration
mflow config show

# Set default branch for specific repository
mflow config set-default-branch frontend main
```

### Status and Monitoring
```bash
# Show feature status across repositories
mflow status <feature-name>

# Check workspace health
mflow doctor

# Show Multimflow information
mflow about
```

## üìä Configuration Structure

Multimflow uses a `.multiflow.yml` file to store workspace configuration:

```yaml
# Repository definitions
repos:
  frontend:
    path: frontend
    hasRemote: true
    defaultBranch: main
  backend:
    path: backend
    hasRemote: true
    defaultBranch: main

# Profile definitions
profiles:
  frontend-only:
    repos: [frontend]
    created: 2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z
  fullstack:
    repos: [frontend, backend, mobile]
    created: 2024-01-15T11:00:00.000Z

# Global settings
settings:
  activeProfile: fullstack

# Active features
features:
  payment-system:
    branch: feature/payment-system
    repos: [frontend, backend]
    created: 2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z
```

## üéÆ Usage Patterns

### 1. **Frontend Developer Workflow**
```bash
# Setup
mflow profile create frontend --repos frontend shared-components
mflow profile switch frontend

# Development
mflow feature create user-interface
# Make changes in frontend repositories
mflow feature commit user-interface -m "Update UI components"
mflow pr user-interface --title "New user interface"
```

### 2. **Backend Developer Workflow**
```bash
# Setup  
mflow profile create backend --repos backend database
mflow profile switch backend

# Development
mflow feature create api-endpoints
# Make changes in backend repositories
mflow feature commit api-endpoints -m "Add new API endpoints"
mflow pr api-endpoints --title "New API endpoints"
```

### 3. **Full-Stack Feature Development**
```bash
# Setup
mflow profile switch fullstack

# Development
mflow feature create payment-integration
# Make changes across all repositories
mflow feature commit payment-integration -m "Add payment processing"
mflow pr payment-integration --title "Payment integration"
```

### 4. **Team Coordination**
```bash
# Pull latest changes across all repositories
mflow pull

# Check workspace health before starting work
mflow doctor

# Create feature affecting specific repositories
mflow profile create payment-team --repos frontend backend payment-service
mflow profile switch payment-team
mflow feature create stripe-integration
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features

- Clear error messages with context
- Operation rollback on critical failures
- Safe defaults for all operations

## üöÄ Performance Features

### 1. **Selective Operations**
- Profile-based filtering reduces operation scope
- Only processes repositories with changes
- Skips unnecessary operations automatically

### 2. **Parallel Processing**
- Concurrent Git operations where safe
