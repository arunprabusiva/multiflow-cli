# Advanced Features

## Selective Operations

Target specific repositories instead of all repos in your workspace.

### Examples

```bash
# Create feature only in frontend and backend
mflow feature create payment --repos frontend,backend

# Commit changes only in backend
mflow feature commit payment -m "Update API" --repos backend

# Cleanup only frontend branch
mflow feature cleanup payment --repos frontend
```

### Use Cases
- **API Changes**: Only backend repos need the feature
- **UI Updates**: Only frontend repos affected
- **Gradual Rollout**: Test in subset of repos first

## Dry Run Mode

Preview what Multimflow would do without actually executing commands.

### Examples

```bash
# See which repos would get the feature branch
mflow feature create payment --dry-run

# Preview what would be committed
mflow feature commit payment -m "Update" --dry-run

# Check what would be cleaned up
mflow feature cleanup payment --dry-run
```

### Output Example
```bash
$ mflow feature create payment --dry-run

üîç Dry run - would create feature branch:
  ‚Ä¢ frontend: feature/payment
  ‚Ä¢ backend: feature/payment
  ‚Ä¢ api-gateway: feature/payment
```

## Auto-Stash

Automatically stash uncommitted changes when creating feature branches.

### Examples

```bash
# Stash changes before creating feature
mflow feature create payment --stash

# Multimflow will:
# 1. Stash uncommitted changes in each repo
# 2. Create the feature branch
# 3. Leave stashes for you to apply later
```

### Stash Management
```bash
# View stashes in a repository
cd frontend
git stash list

# Apply stash when ready
git stash pop
```

## Smart Error Handling

Multimflow handles partial failures gracefully and gives you options.

### Partial Success Example
```bash
$ mflow feature create payment

‚úÖ frontend: Created feature/payment
‚úÖ backend: Created feature/payment
‚ùå database: Failed - uncommitted changes
‚ùå docs: Failed - branch already exists

‚ö†Ô∏è  Partial success: 2/4 repositories
```

### Branch Existence Check
```bash
$ mflow feature create payment

‚ùå Error: Branch 'feature/payment' already exists in: frontend, backend
üí° Tip: Use different name or cleanup existing branches first
```

## Repository Ignoring

Exclude repositories from Multimflow operations.

### .multiflowignore File
```
# Multimflow ignore file
# Add repository names (one per line)

docs
scripts
old-prototype
temp-experiments
```

### Commands
```bash
# Add to ignore list
mflow config ignore docs

# Remove from ignore list  
mflow config unignore docs

# View current configuration
mflow config show
```

### Ignore Patterns
- **Documentation repos**: `docs`, `wiki`
- **Build/deployment**: `scripts`, `deploy`, `ci`
- **Experiments**: `prototype`, `spike`, `temp`
- **Legacy code**: `old-*`, `legacy-*`

## Combining Features

Advanced features work together for powerful workflows.

### Example: Careful Feature Creation
```bash
# Create feature with all safety features
mflow feature create payment \
  --repos frontend,backend \
  --stash \
  --dry-run

# Review the plan, then execute without --dry-run
mflow feature create payment \
  --repos frontend,backend \
  --stash
```

### Example: Selective Cleanup
```bash
# Cleanup only completed repos
mflow feature cleanup payment --repos frontend

# Keep working on backend
mflow status payment
# ‚îú‚îÄ backend: feature/payment ‚úÖ ready
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use --dry-run first** for destructive operations
2. **Use --stash** when switching contexts frequently  
3. **Use --repos** for focused development
4. **Ignore non-code repositories** to reduce noise
5. **Check status** before cleanup to avoid losing work
